# FAST-LIVOSAM
This project is developed for the paper “Robust Urban SLAM via Resilient GNSS–IMU–LiDAR–Camera–Loop Fusion”. It is adapted and extended from FAST-LIVO2, aiming to realize a tightly coupled GNSS–LiDAR–IMU–Camera multi-sensor factor-graph-based SLAM framework for robust localization and mapping in complex urban environments.
